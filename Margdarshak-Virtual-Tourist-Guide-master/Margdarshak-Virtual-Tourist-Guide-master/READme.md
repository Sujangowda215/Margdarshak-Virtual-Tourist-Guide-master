Our Virtual Tour Guide App is one of its kind as there is no other app which resonates with the audience the way our app does. This app is made for the users who need to login to use it which helps in maintaining a statistical information of the users and the number of references to a monument. The application allows the user to click a photograph and based on the picture display information about the monument/landmark. It also notifies the user about such monuments/landmarks in the vicinity. The app also allows the user to give their inputs about the object and add it to knowledge creation about the monuments/landmark. The Chat bot is an inbuilt application which facilitates user-friendly communication and emulates a real tour guide and eases the user interface with our app. Also the app communicates in whatever language the user is comfortable in. The app uses concepts of Machine Learning to function. Using the machine learning as a tool ensures high accuracy and efficiency since the application developed on the android platform would be able to learn by itself.
